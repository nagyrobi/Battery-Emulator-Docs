## Installing the software
Follow the [quickstart guide](https://github.com/dalathegreat/Battery-Emulator?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-install-the-software-) to install the Battery-Emulator software onto the board for the initial setup

## Over the air (OTA) software updates
When updating this board [OTA](https://github.com/dalathegreat/Battery-Emulator/wiki/OTA-Update), be sure to select the software marked for this board. The files will be marked like this, signaling that this is **Stark** hardware

`BE_vX.Y.Z_StarkCMR.ota.bin`

## Interfaces
The board comes with 2 CAN channels, the second one of them being capable of CAN-FD. The board also has an RS485 channel, which can be used for Modbus inverters or RS485 batteries.

<img width="377" height="243" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e8ffc8b-642d-4d4d-8cfb-c80f2be35d69" />

The interfaces correspond to the following options in the Battery-Emulator software

- CAN-1 -> **Native CAN**
   - CAN 1L (CAN-LOW)
   - CAN 1H (CAN-HIGH)
- CAN-2 -> **Native CAN FD**
   - CAN 2L (CAN-LOW)
   - CAN 2H (CAN-HIGH)
   - Note, this channel can be used as classic CAN by enabling "Use CanFD as classic CAN" option
- RS485 -> **RS485 / Modbus**
   - RS485 A
   - RS485 B

### Adding a third CAN channel
For integrations that need double/triple battery support via CAN, you can add an MCP251**5** add-on board via the GPIO expansion header. Connect the wires as following:

- SCK to 14
- SDI to 12
- SDO to 34
- CS to 15
- INT to 13
- GND to GND
- VCC to 5V source (Same as USB cable powering board?)

## Example connection diagram
This is an example wiring diagram for connecting the Stark CRM, a Nissan Leaf battery pack, a Fronius inverter and an E-stop button (NC). This diagram shows _high side_ switching contactors which is found in most battery packs. I.e. +12V is "fed into" the battery on the dedicated pins to close the contactors.

<img alt="68747470733a2f2f7265646973706f73652e73652f696d6167652f636174616c6f672f73636d725f776972696e675f6c6561665f66726f2e706e67" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2102e1b6-e08b-4872-9f3e-bb4aa8bda71d" />

_Notes: All connections marked GND on the SCMR are joined via the GND plane of the PCB. 5V is the suggested voltage level for the E-stop in this case but it will also work using 12V or 3.3V._

The configuration for the above example would look like this:

<img width="534" height="887" alt="491962914-521d84d1-ed0a-47f9-ba9c-b26f861f1497" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6ec3adb-3d89-4059-99a6-ca212ba6a873" />


The next wiring diagram shows an example for wiring a Renault Zoe battery. This differs from the previous example as the contactors use _low side_ switching, i.e. the contactors will be closed when the dedicated pins from the contactors on the battery are "shorted to ground".
