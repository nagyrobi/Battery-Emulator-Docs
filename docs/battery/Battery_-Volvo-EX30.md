## Note on crash lock :boom:
Batteries that have been involved in a severe collision will be crash locked. You can unlock the battery by pressing the "Unlock crashed BMS" button in the More Battery Info weserver page. Remember that the pyrofuse most likely also is blown if the crash status is set.

Volvo EX30 batteries can be unlocked this way, but Zeekr SEA based batteries require a more involving security algoritm that is not yet implemented in the software.

## Note on recall :fire: 
If you are planning to use a 69kWh NMC pack from an EX30, be aware that there is a recall on ~3000 vehicles related to risk of battery fires at high SOC. Try to avoid using one of these affected batteries.

Affected VINs seem to all be:
EK = E400V14 '25- EX30 AWD, '26- EX30 Cross Country AWD
EL = E400V18 '25- EX30 RWD

| 1 | KL30 | +12v |
| 4 | Coolant level sensor | 1 kOhm resistor between pin 4 and pin 5 |

| 8 | HVIL 3 In | Connect direct to pin 12 |
| 9 | HVIL 2 In | Connect direct to pin 10 |
| 10 | HVIL 2 Out | Connect direct to pin 9 |
| 12 | HVIL 3 Out | Connect direct to pin 8 |
| 19 | Ground | 12v ground |
| 22 | Fast charge temp sensor | 12 kOhm resistor between pin 22 and pin 29 |
| 24 | Propulsion CAN L | CAN-L |
| 25 | Fast charge temp sensor | 12 kOhm resistor between pin 31 and pin 25 |
| 26 | CPSR | +12v |
| 27 | Propulsion CAN H | CAN-H |
| 29 | Fast charge temp sensor | 12 kOhm resistor between pin 22 and pin 29 |
| 31 | Fast charge temp sensor | 12 kOhm resistor between pin 31 and pin 25 |
| 32 | KL30 | +12v |

* Connect 12v ground to the battery chassis.
* Make sure that the correct (60ohm) termination resistance is present between CAN-H and CAN-L, there is no built in resistor in the battery. (you should most likely add a 120ohm resistor at the battery connector)
* Also make sure to jumper the HVIL loop in the unused high voltage connectors. (make sure to isolate/block the access to the connectors as they will/could have over 400v accessible when the system is running)

## Reading DTCs
1. To read the DTCs you have to open another browser tab with the CAN-logger view.
2. Enter filter 1588, press OK. Then press "Stop & Back to main page" (the filter setting will persist), reopen CAN logger and it should be cleared and the filter is active. 
3. Press "More battery info" in the other tab and press read DTC.
4. Refresh the CAN-log and you should have the readout there. (BE performs a bunch of diag requests once a minute that also will end up in the log with that filter, but that is normal)


DTCs are presented with 4 bytes, last byte of each code is status. (Permanent, Intermittent)

Codes might be divided between consecutive CAN frames, but just add them together like marked in the image below.
