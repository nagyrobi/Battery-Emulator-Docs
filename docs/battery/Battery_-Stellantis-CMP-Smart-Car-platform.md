## Low voltage connector

LFP low voltage connector - in stock on [Mouser](https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/JST-Automotive/27ZRO-B-1A?qs=Li%252BoUPsLEnuUscRf1zwznw%3D%3D), in case you are not able to get the harness with the connector when you buy the battery.
The connector has the pin numbering stamped on it.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | CAN H | (Connect to Battery Emulator CAN H)
| 2 | CAN L | (Connect to Battery Emulator CAN L)
| 5 | 12V | (Connect to permanent 12V)
| 6 | 12V | (Connect to permanent 12V)

| 10 | 12V | (Connect to permanent 12V)
| 11 | HVIL | (Connect to pin 12)
| 12 | HVIL | (Connect to pin 11)
| 13 | GND | (Connect to GND for the 12V feed)
| 14 | GND | (Connect to GND for the 12V feed)
| 21 | NTC | (Connect 10k resistor to pin 22) | 
| 22 | NTC | (Connect to resistor on pin 21) |

### Note on WUP
WakeUpPin (WUP) can be used to make the battery survive a reset/reboot in the software. If you connect all 4x 12V pins to the WUP pin via a relay/SSR, you can perform graceful reboots without needing to cycle 12V to the battery to get it to work after a reboot/OTA.

## Software configuration
To use this battery, select the "Stellantis CMP Smart Car Battery" battery option

## Troubleshooting
- If the battery is crashed hard or detects a massive isolation leak, it will lock itself and display Battery Fault Level 5. Currently, we have no way to reset this!

- Here is the internal layout of contactors. 
We engage Main Pos and Main Neg.
