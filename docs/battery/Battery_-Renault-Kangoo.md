## FAQ: Renault Kangoo Battery
Renault Zoe support is still being developed. The Kangoo shares a fair share of CAN data with the Renault Zoe and Renault Fluence

## Variants of the Kangoo
There are 3x batteries available for the Kangoo:
* 22kWh 2011-2016
   * Can be used with the `Renault Kangoo` setting
   * NOTE: Sometimes SOC does not update on these packs, this can be solved by switching to the "Use Estimated SOC" option
* 33kWh 2017-2021
   * Can be used with Zoe Gen1 software setting: `Renault Zoe Gen1 22/40kWh`
* 44kWh 2022+

Physical size;
* Weight 295 kg (22kWh)
* Weight 260 kg (33kWh)
* Dimensions 1214 x 802 x 290mm

**The 33kWh pack doesn't have a negative contactor, the only way to isolate it is to pull the service disconnect.** In the contactor box there's a current sensor, pre-charge resistor, pre-charge relay, main contactor and a 275a 1000V fuse. The main contactor is 150a rated.
