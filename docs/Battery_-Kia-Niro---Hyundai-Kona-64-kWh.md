# Kia e-Niro 64 kWh / Hyundai Kona Electric 64 kWh

## A word of caution about battery fires 🔥
> [!CAUTION]
> The batteries manufactured by LG Chem were recalled due to fire risk. If you are using a battery from a vehicle that did not get the recall, there is a higher risk to re-use these 64kWh batteries. The recall started in 2021, so if you are using a battery from a vehicle that was crashed before 2021, there is a high probability you have an pre-recall battery. **You have been warned!**

What are the affected vehicles? The subject vehicles include:

• Approximately 4,694 model year 2019-2020 Hyundai Kona Electric vehicles produced from August 28, 2018 through March 2, 2020. 

• Approximately 2 model year 2020 Hyundai Ioniq Electric vehicles produced from November 8, 2019 through November 11, 2019.
   
This was done under program Recall 200 - https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCMN-21V127-9103.pdf

So can it be that the battery donor car is from 2020 or 2021 but has received the new battery, good to check then the battery label production date.

Remark;
It is possible the BMS in the battery needs a 12v powercycle for 10 ~ 20 sec , after that or at the same time boot the Lilly and contractors are closed and HIGH VOLTAGE !! is active on the battery pins.

This also applies when a emergency knob/button is installed in the interlock lus. when lus is interupted the whole battery systems needs a 12v powercycle to be active again.

## Wiring info

⚠️ The CAN communication has no error checking. This means it is prone to corruption if it sits close to a high voltage line. Use shielded twisted pair cables for CAN-H and CAN-L , and connect the shield to protective earth in one end of the circuit. 

Attached below are pictures of the BMS pinouts. Connect the pins to the LilyGo and 12V supply like this:

* Pin 1/2 to 12V
* Pin 10 to LilyGo CAN - H (connect resistor 120 Ohm across 10 CAN - H and 11 CAN - L)
* Pin 11 to LilyGo CAN - L
* Pin 12 to 12V (Ignition)
* Pin 3 and 14 connect together (interlock loop)
* Pin 33 to 12V GND
* Place 12k resistor between Pin9  and Pin31
* Place 12k resistor between Pin8  and Pin30
* Place 12k resistor between Pin27 and Pin28

#### Notes on type of HV cable
39kwh (2022) was with metal silver HV socket (looks like early 39/64 packs), 64kwh pack was 2020 with orange plastic HV socket. And these HV sockets looks same but they are mechanically different. For easiest way, try to get the HV cable from the same vehicle that you are getting the battery from!

Silver one needs HV cable p/n 91662K4000 (Picture below)
Orange one needs HV cable p/n 91662K4100

<img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52c55356-db0a-4b67-aba7-0debbba0a857" />

## HVIL
The battery packs has interlock monitoring on all high voltage connections. To get the contactors to engage, the battery needs to see that all plugs have been seated. If you dont have the original plugs, these are the HVIL connectors that need to be connected together to make the battery think the connectors are seated:

Low voltage side: Pin 3 and 14 must be connected on data plug

These two pins on the high voltage plug:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52da5cce-7783-4ed8-acff-d81cfd9f021b)

Two pins on the heater plug must be joined:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf2117b4-67db-495c-8c0f-521c0f7d6f65)

If the service disconnect switch is missing, these two small pins must be shorted together.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fe24689-10fc-4920-9b28-b304b5a6ac28)

Plus, the HV side must be connected together (diagram missing for running without service disconnect plug). Due to this, it is recommended to get the OEM service disconnect plug before continuing.

## STL files for unused battery connections

There are STL files available to 3D print covers for the unused battery connectors.



## Special notes on 37501-AO050 battery
There is a 2022+ Hyundai Kona or Kia e-niro battery that uses CAN-FD, that comes with a AO050 part number sticker. It is CATL made, it consist in 24 modules(2.835 kwh) x 4 cells(3.7v), configured 96s1p(358v in total) 64.8kwh(68.4 in total)

This battery has the part number 37501-AO050, and this battery requires a CAN-FD hardware interface. Easiest to get a [Stark CMR](https://github.com/dalathegreat/Battery-Emulator/wiki/Hardware:-Stark-CMR), but you can also add a [CANFD addon interface](https://github.com/dalathegreat/Battery-Emulator/wiki/CAN%E2%80%90FD-add%E2%80%90on-(MCP2518FD)). To use this battery, enable the `Kia 64kWh FD battery` option in the software.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The contactor control for these FD batteries are not working, they open after a few seconds. To get around this, you need to force the contactors closed with 12V/GND. This can be automated with GPIO Controlled contactors

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e20fa9b-7586-4032-9b2d-74c1ffafcb0a)

### Manual contactor control on the 37501-AO050 FD battery
To setup manual contactor control, open the battery lid, and locate the contactor assembly box

<img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0c65aa0-4589-466e-b94d-2bbfd16a9cf5" />

You can connect your own contactor control wiring directly to the white plug.

<img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/263549a8-1869-4c75-ab1f-535902cbd063" />

To get the contactor control wires out of the battery (and into the Battery-Emulator GPIO), you can use the unused pins on the low voltage connector:

<img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edd6e0c5-ff15-41a8-9429-40443769e940" />

For controlling the contactors, it is enough to take out 3 wires outside the battery (precharge+, contPos+, contNeg+), the negative side is common with the BMS power supply.

- white for contactor control positive
- brown/orange for contactor control negative
- yellow/orange for pre-charging

Connect these three wires to the GPIO via relay/SSR.

## Troubleshooting 

If you see Battery Voltage being reported as 6553.5V, it means that the battery is having internal issues.

- Check if all cells are visible on the Cellmonitor page
   - If all cells are not visible, you have a blown fuse on one of the balancing lines
   - Another user reported corrosion on one of the balance lead plugs
   - Whatever the case, opening the battery and investigating is required if cellvoltages are missing

## Notes on waterdamage :droplet: 

> [!WARNING]
> These batteries are not waterproof. Water can easily enter thru the service disconnect switch. Store and operate in a dry area!

Attached pictures from packs that did not detect all cells. Root cause was water damage, causing fuses and PCB traces to blow up. Placing batteries vertically can make water sloosh around and short out. You have been warned!
