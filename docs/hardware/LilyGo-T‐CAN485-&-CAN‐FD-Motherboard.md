## LilyGo T-CAN485 & CAN-FD Motherboard

This is work in progress **BETA** PCB design for a motherboard to hold both a lillygo T-CAN485, a CAN FD board and a smart highside power switch for contactors. Requires a small amount of SMD soldering. You will need to desolder the output connectors on the lillygo + can FD board.

* Current version 1.1

## Overview of features

* Four channel smart high side power switch (short circuit, overload & thermal protection) 4th channel input&output is on terminal other 3 inputs are sourced from lillygo) 2.6A nominal per channel (6.5A current limit)
* MCP2518FD CAN_FD module
* Pluggable/swappable Lilygo and CAN-FD modules
* Entire cost should be around 55USD
* Requires both 12V (contactors) and 5V input



## BOM
* 1x PCB [Link](https://oshwlab.com/cloudy62/batemudaughterboard)  - Please make your own checks before manufacturing
* 1x 83mm DIN Rail case with terminals AK-DR-105A [Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006067012648.html)
* 1x SPI To CANFD MCP2518FD Module (must be this style) [Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007349452566.html)
* 1x 6A round PCB fuse
* 2x 2x6 2.54mm pin header sockets (Lilygo and Can data header)
* 1x 1x2 2.54mm pin header socket (lilgo power header)
* 9x 1 way 2.54mm pin header sockets (singles as they don't quite match the spacing, might be better options)
* 4x 1206 4k7 SMD resistors
* 2x [Optional] 1206 120ohm resistors (if you need to add termination on either can-bus) Both boards also have can jumpers
* 1x Infineon BTS716G [Link](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/Infineon-Technologies/BTS716G?qs=MGskQgfwDzus89Wlyk6rrg%3D%3D&srsltid=AfmBOorB3UWUL11UHGQ6T4TqtPE6G-uxXzaoZuVttZVdFuyMxHTPvx4-)


## Notes

* Requires 20Mhz setting for CANFD (#define CANFD_ADDON_CRYSTAL_FREQUENCY_MHZ  ACAN2517FDSettings::OSC_20MHz)
* LillyGo is a tight fit in the case!
