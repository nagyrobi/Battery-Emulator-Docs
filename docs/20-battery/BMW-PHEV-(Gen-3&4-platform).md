# BMW Gen3 & 4 PHV Platform - (330e 530e X5-45e)

BMW uses a shared modular platform across various vehicles with a common BMS (SME).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Currently integration needs manual contactor control - We have Gen 3 logs, still looking for Gen4 (~2021+) can-logs from a BMW PHEV vehicle to build contactor control (K-CAN5)
